## Summary

ChemInformant is a Python client engineered for programmatic access to PubChem, specifically targeting high-throughput and automated data retrieval tasks. Its architecture streamlines the entire workflow from data acquisition to analysis by directly converting large, mixed-type lists of chemical identifiers into analysis-ready Pandas DataFrames [@Pandas]. To ensure operational resilience, the package natively integrates a suite of robustness features, including persistent HTTP caching, automatic rate-limiting with exponential backoff retries, and runtime data validation using Pydantic [@Pydantic]. By systematically addressing critical limitations in existing tools—such as network instability and inefficient batch processing—and offering up to a 48-fold performance increase, ChemInformant delivers a significantly more reliable and efficient component for the modern Python cheminformatics ecosystem.

## Statement of Need

As these workflows become increasingly automated and scaled, researchers encounter recurring challenges with existing client libraries, primarily concerning network reliability, batch processing capabilities, and a lack of workflow-centric API design.

First, network stability is a significant operational concern. The PubChem API service [@Kim2018PUGREST] enforces dynamic rate limits (e.g., ≤5 requests per second) and may return HTTP 503 (Server Busy) errors during periods of high traffic [@PubChemUsagePolicy]. Many existing clients, such as PubChemPy [@PubChemPy], do not include built-in mechanisms for automatic request throttling or exponential backoff retries. This can lead to script fragility in automated environments, often requiring users to implement manual delays. Furthermore, the general absence of a persistent caching layer results in redundant network requests for repeated queries, which increases latency and unnecessarily consumes API usage quotas.

Second, limitations in handling heterogeneous inputs and providing clear error feedback for batch operations create inefficiencies in high-throughput data processing. Scientific workflows often involve large lists of mixed-type identifiers (e.g., a combination of names, CIDs, and SMILES). Typically, existing tools require users to pre-process these lists into homogeneous groups, adding a preparatory step to the workflow. Additionally, their fault tolerance for batch queries can be limited; a single invalid identifier may cause an entire operation to fail or return incomplete data without explicitly indicating which inputs were problematic. The lack of structured partial success and failure reporting complicates error diagnostics and can affect the reliability of data acquisition pipelines.

Furthermore, the architecture of existing client libraries underscores the need for a shift toward more modern, workflow-centric designs. While tools such as PubChemPy [@PubChemPy] are cornerstones in the field, they were designed in an era that prioritized the direct implementation of core API functionalities. Consequently, features like automatic retries for network errors, persistent caching with sensible cross-platform defaults, and fine-grained error handling were often left for the developer to implement. This paradigm requires users building automated workflows to write significant boilerplate code to manage concerns such as API rate-limiting and cache path configuration, thereby diverting focus from their core scientific objectives.

These design decisions directly compound the aforementioned challenges in network stability and batch processing efficiency. In the absence of built-in fault-tolerance mechanisms, processing large, heterogeneous datasets becomes precarious, as a single invalid input can be sufficient to halt an entire workflow. ChemInformant was developed specifically to address these gaps. By natively integrating robustness, efficiency, and a "zero-configuration-first" philosophy at the architectural level, it provides a more resilient and streamlined modern tool, enabling researchers to concentrate on scientific analysis rather than the low-level mechanics of data acquisition.

## State of the Field and Comparison

To contextualize `ChemInformant`, a comparative analysis was conducted against related tools, including PubChemPy, PubChemR [@PubChemR], webchem [@webchem], ChemSpiPy [@ChemSpiPy], and PubChem4J [@PubChem4J]. **Table 1** outlines the features of these tools across several dimensions relevant to automated research workflows. The maintenance status of several key libraries is particularly noteworthy: PubChemPy has not had a formal release since 2017, and ChemSpiPy has been inactive since 2018, which underscores the need for a modern, actively maintained tool.

[^3]: **Fault Tolerance**: Provides structured status reporting for each item in a batch query, avoiding complete failure on a single error.



## Performance Evaluation

To quantify the performance of `ChemInformant`'s design, a benchmark test was performed to retrieve six different properties for a list of 285 drug names. For a direct, same-platform comparison, `PubChemPy` was selected as the baseline. Because `PubChemPy`'s batch property interface does not accept names as input, the test procedure first resolved all names to CIDs. The performance of both libraries was then timed on processing the resulting list of CIDs.

**Table 2** summarizes the performance data for the 280 successfully resolved compounds.

**Table 2: Performance benchmark results.**

| Scenario | Time (s) | Speed-up (vs. PubChemPy) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| PubChemPy (batch interface) | 6.50 | 1× (Baseline) |
| **ChemInformant — Cold Cache** | **1.40** | **4.6×** |
| **ChemInformant — Warm Cache** | **0.135** | **48×** |

The initial `ChemInformant` batch query completed in **1.4 seconds**, a **4.6-fold** increase in speed compared to `PubChemPy`'s 6.5 seconds. A subsequent query from the cache finished in **135 milliseconds**, representing an overall 48-fold speed-up relative to the baseline. This sub-200ms response time is suitable for interactive applications. The script used for this benchmark is available in the project repository.

## Example Usage

`ChemInformant` offers a layered API, with convenience functions for single lookups and a core engine for batch processing.

**Convenience API Example (for single lookups):**
```python
import ChemInformant as ci

# Retrieve a single property for one identifier
cas_number = ci.get_cas("ibuprofen")
# > '15687-27-1'
````

**Core API Example (for batch data analysis):**

```python
# Retrieve multiple properties for a list of mixed-identifier types
df = ci.get_properties(
    identifiers=["aspirin", "caffeine", 1983], # Mix of names and a CID
    properties=["molecular_weight", "xlogp", "cas"]
)
# The returned DataFrame is formatted for direct use in downstream analysis tools
print(df)
```

A more detailed user manual, including examples of how to integrate with other analysis tools, is available in the project repository.
