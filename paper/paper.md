## Summary

ChemInformant is a Python client designed for programmatic access to PubChem, with a focus on high-throughput and automated data retrieval tasks. Its architecture facilitates the direct conversion of various chemical identifiers, including mixed-type lists, into analysis-ready Pandas DataFrames [@Pandas], aiming to streamline workflows from data acquisition to analysis. The package integrates several features to enhance operational robustness, such as persistent HTTP caching, automatic rate-limiting with exponential backoff retries, and runtime data validation using Pydantic [@Pydantic]. In benchmark tests comparing batch property retrieval, ChemInformant demonstrated a 4.6-fold performance increase over a widely-used library in initial queries. With caching enabled, this advantage increased to 48-fold, yielding response times suitable for interactive data analysis. By addressing identified limitations in existing tools related to network reliability, batch processing, and maintainability, ChemInformant provides a reliable and efficient component for the Python cheminformatics ecosystem.

## Statement of Need

Programmatic access to the PubChem database [@PubChem] is a foundational component for many research workflows in chemistry and life sciences. As these workflows become increasingly automated and scaled, researchers encounter recurring challenges with existing client libraries, primarily concerning network reliability, batch processing capabilities, and the long-term sustainability of the tools themselves.

First, network stability is a significant operational concern. The PubChem API service [@Kim2018PUGREST] enforces dynamic rate limits (e.g., ≤5 requests per second) and may return `HTTP 503 (Server Busy)` errors during periods of high traffic [@PubChemUsagePolicy]. Many existing clients, such as PubChemPy [@PubChemPy], do not include built-in mechanisms for automatic request throttling or exponential backoff retries. This can lead to script fragility in automated environments, often requiring users to implement manual delays. Furthermore, the general absence of a persistent caching layer results in redundant network requests for repeated queries, which increases latency and unnecessarily consumes API usage quotas.

Second, limitations in handling heterogeneous inputs and providing clear error feedback for batch operations create inefficiencies in high-throughput data processing. Scientific workflows often involve large lists of mixed-type identifiers (e.g., a combination of names, CIDs, and SMILES). Typically, existing tools require users to pre-process these lists into homogeneous groups, adding a preparatory step to the workflow. Additionally, their fault tolerance for batch queries can be limited; a single invalid identifier may cause an entire operation to fail or return incomplete data without explicitly indicating which inputs were problematic. The lack of structured partial success and failure reporting complicates error diagnostics and can affect the reliability of data acquisition pipelines.

Finally, the maintenance status of some client libraries presents a potential risk to the long-term reproducibility of research. For example, PubChemPy, a prominent library in the Python ecosystem, has not had a formal release since 2017. A lack of active maintenance can prevent a tool from adapting to changes in the underlying PubChem API and from incorporating community-requested improvements. This may compel users to develop custom workarounds or combine multiple tools, which often do not systematically address the aforementioned stability and efficiency challenges.

Consequently, there is a need for a client library that integrates robustness, efficiency, and maintainability at an architectural level. ChemInformant was developed to address these specific gaps, providing the Python cheminformatics community with an extensible and performant data access tool designed for long-term use in automated research environments.

## State of the Field and Comparison

To contextualize `ChemInformant`, a comparative analysis was conducted against related tools, including PubChemPy, PubChemR [@PubChemR], webchem [@webchem], ChemSpiPy [@ChemSpiPy], and PubChem4J [@PubChem4J]. **Table 1** outlines the features of these tools across several dimensions relevant to automated research workflows.

## Performance Evaluation

To quantify the performance of `ChemInformant`'s design, a benchmark test was performed to retrieve six different properties for a list of 285 drug names. For a direct, same-platform comparison, `PubChemPy` was selected as the baseline. Because `PubChemPy`'s batch property interface does not accept names as input, the test procedure first resolved all names to CIDs. The performance of both libraries was then timed on processing the resulting list of CIDs.

**Table 2** summarizes the performance data for the 280 successfully resolved compounds.

**Table 2: Performance benchmark results.**

| Scenario | Time (s) | Speed-up (vs. PubChemPy) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| PubChemPy (batch interface) | 6.50 | 1× (Baseline) |
| **ChemInformant — Cold Cache** | **1.40** | **4.6×** |
| **ChemInformant — Warm Cache** | **0.135** | **48×** |

The initial `ChemInformant` batch query completed in **1.4 seconds**, a **4.6-fold** increase in speed compared to `PubChemPy`'s 6.5 seconds. A subsequent query from the cache finished in **135 milliseconds**, representing an overall 48-fold speed-up relative to the baseline. This sub-200ms response time is suitable for interactive applications. The script used for this benchmark is available in the project repository.

## Example Usage

`ChemInformant` offers a layered API, with convenience functions for single lookups and a core engine for batch processing.

**Convenience API Example (for single lookups):**
```python
import ChemInformant as ci

# Retrieve a single property for one identifier
cas_number = ci.get_cas("ibuprofen")
# > '15687-27-1'
````

**Core API Example (for batch data analysis):**

```python
# Retrieve multiple properties for a list of mixed-identifier types
df = ci.get_properties(
    identifiers=["aspirin", "caffeine", 1983], # Mix of names and a CID
    properties=["molecular_weight", "xlogp", "cas"]
)
# The returned DataFrame is formatted for direct use in downstream analysis tools
print(df)
```

A more detailed user manual, including examples of how to integrate with other analysis tools, is available in the project repository.
