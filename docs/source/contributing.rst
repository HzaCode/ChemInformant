    .. code-block:: bash

       pip install -e .[dev]

5.  **Create a branch:** Create a new branch for your changes.

    .. code-block:: bash

       git checkout -b your-feature-or-bugfix-branch

Code Style
~~~~~~~~~~~~

*   ChemInformant follows the **PEP 8** style guide.
*   We use **Black** for automatic code formatting. Before committing your changes, please run Black to format your code:

    .. code-block:: bash

       pytest tests/

Submitting a Pull Request
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.  Make your code changes, write tests, and format your code with Black.
2.  Commit your changes with a clear and descriptive commit message.
3.  Push your branch to your fork on GitHub:

    .. code-block:: bash

       git push origin your-feature-or-bugfix-branch
