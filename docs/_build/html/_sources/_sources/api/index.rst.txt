API Reference
*************

This section provides detailed documentation for the classes, functions,
and modules within the ChemInformant library.

Use the navigation panel on the left (under the "API Reference" heading)
to browse the specific modules, such as the ``ChemInfo API`` and
``Data Models``.

The documentation pages for each module are automatically generated from
the library's source code comments (docstrings).

.. (Optional: Add a brief overview paragraph here about the main components
   or design philosophy of your library if you like.)
